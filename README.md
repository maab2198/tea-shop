# Tea Order App

Simple react.js application based on Maximilian Schwarzmüller's course on Udemy.

The main goal of this project is to blow the dust off my coding skills. Extend and organize knowledge about React ecosystem :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:

## Tech

- React state
- Portals & Modals
- Cart Context
- Refs
- Hooks: useEffect, useState, useReducer, custom hooks
- Firebase realtime database and hosting
- Request: get products, post the order
- Css modules
- Styles: grid, isolation, animation

## Basic Idea from Udemy course

- React hooks practice
- Create basic food order app
  - displaying meals
  - adding or removing products from the cart
  - ordering is not implemented
- Style React apps with CSS Modules
- Work with "Portals" and "Context"

## My extended implementation

- Real data from [this amazitng shop](https://www.theteamakers.co.uk/collections/chinese-tea)
- Dummy api using firebase
- Http requests & handling transitional states + responses
- Deale with side effects
- Custom hooks
- Responsive web
- Acient China vibe

**What is 茶馆?**

Only in this particular case 茶馆 sounds similar to "cha guan" and means "tea shop".
Sometimes all you need is a good cup of Cha, to make everything better
